# Following Along with Crafting Interpreters 

This is the code associated with the
[Crafting Interpreters textbook](https://craftinginterpreters.com/).
I am uploading the code that I write (read:
the code that gets written as I follow along with the textbook).
However, the code in its entirety is
[already available online](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/tree/master).
I.e., just skip this repository and head to the complete source!
